# Log March 4 2013

1. I've been very busy. At the most basic level, I have now marked up all 18 extracts. That is, I have used XML to tag the things I feel need to be tagged (including vowel/consonant density, etc.), and have made them web-readable using CSS. I've mostly used Notepad++ and Notepad to do this, due to their portability, and my mobility. That being said, only 9 texts have been given any real consideration in terms of formatting and presentation, and are at a stage I would call "complete". Unfortunately, I still haven't figured out how to preserve white space using CSS or the XML "preserve" tag. Thus, those texts marked "complete", are complete *except* for proper line justification -- a problem I may or may not be able to resolve before the end of term. Nonetheless, I've now spent many, many hours on this, and feel that it's finally starting to come together. Yatta!

2. Using photoshop and CSS, I've included a nifty "paper" background for each extract to better reflect the "paper" medium whence our extracts ultimately originate.

3. I've documented my workflow using a combination of screenshots and text; I'll upload it tonight. 

4. For anyone interested, my "VowelsAndConsonants" Java program has been immensely useful, but doesn't seem to understand what to do with em-dashes. An odd error, but one that's easy enough to work around.

As always, the relevant draft components of my project (and my workflow) will be located under my personal "resurgam" repo, in the directory, "longNowEncoding"
