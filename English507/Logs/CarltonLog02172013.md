#David Carlton Log February 17, 2013

1. I have saved a few screenshots of my progress over the last week, and will upload them under my Resurgam 

account here on Github

2. I've tested my schema, and it works perfectly so far.

3. I quickly wrote a program in Java to count the number of vowels and consonants in each text extract. It 

seems to work really well, especially at handling white space. I'll upload the code under my account for those interested.

4. I've been trying to use XML/CSS to preserve white space in my marked up extracts, but to no avail. The 

"preserve" tag isn't working as it should, so I'll have to think of something else.

5. I marked up the "Penelope" extract, and expressed it using a modified version of the CSS and XML from my 

Aldhelm project. Pretty much everything is included, except for proper text justification (dang white 

space!). There are a few extraneous bits in the CSS, but they aren't harming anything, so I'll leave them 

in for now. Tonight, I'll upload all the stuff I've done so far.
