# Prospectus for “The Long Now of *Ulysses*”

Co-curated by Jentery Sayers, Stephen Ross, English 507, and English 560 (Spring 2013) 

Author: Stephen Ross, edited by David Carlton

## Rationale

“The Long Now of *Ulysses*” takes the modernist fascination with time and space as its cornerstone, using James Joyce’s modernist masterpiece *Ulysses* as a springboard for presentation of a rich context of historical, cultural, and aesthetic materials in a range of media. It will introduce visitors to the broad contexts of modernism even as it brings to light both the everyday content and the avant-garde stylistic dimensions of the novel. The exhibit takes *Ulysses* as its starting point for several reasons: we have it and are concluding the first-ever publication of it online, it’s perhaps the sine qua non of high modernist literary production (barring only The Waste Land), and it was at the very center of a dizzyingly productive time and place -- Paris in the 1910s and 1920s -- and formed part of the context for, and was contextualised by, virtually every significant aspect of modernist cultural production. As such, it is not simply an instance of modernism, but perhaps its key metonym: the part that can stand for the whole, directing us out from its centrality to the rich context in which it emerged and which it in turn helped shape. In this respect, and as the ongoing fascination with modernist aesthetics demonstrates (e.g., the popularity of Mad Men, the recent worldwide tour of the Vorticist exhibit), we remain firmly in the long now of Ulysses even today. This exhibit will extend this long now across media, times, and places to suggest ways in which we might still treat *Ulysses* as a springboard into the cultures of modernity and even postmodernity. 

## Curation

The exhibit will be co-curated by Drs. Jentery Sayers and Ross, who will oversee the creative and collaborative contributions of the graduate students in Dr. Sayers' English 507 course (“Introduction to Digital Humanities”). The students will be responsible for developing the exhibit methodologies, including some use of intelligent environments and overcoming technological challenges. The faculty will be responsible for the content of the exhibit, and will provide content expertise, including selecting the materials to be displayed. Both groups will ultimately collaborate on the final presentation and selection of all pertinent materials and technologies, so that the final exhibit is both aesthetically/theoretically functional and technologically feasible.

## Organization

The exhibit is organized into seventeen panels corresponding to the seventeen display cabinet sections arranged around the perimeter of the exhibit space, and in the six display cabinet sections located in the centre of the space. Each of the perimeter panels corresponds with an hour in the novel, whose episodes occur in approximately one-hour increments. The first panel will do double duty, displaying the hour of 8:00 am which is narrated twice in episodes 1 and 4 (first from Stephen Dedalus’s perspective and then from Leopold Bloom’s). The remaining panels will each correspond to a different hour and episode of the novel. 

## Perimeter Panels 

Each of the perimeter panels will be arranged around a large blow-up of twenty-two lines from a page in the novel. The pages have been chosen by applying an algorithm to the 1922 first edition of the novel as follows: given that the novel is set on June 16, 1904 and was published in 1922, we have taken 6, 16, and 22 as significant numbers. Starting with the first page of each episode, we counted six pages in and sixteen lines down from the top of the page to begin the excerpts we’ll blow up, and then excerpted 22 lines of text for the poster. This approach means that each panel is constituted by a given text whose significance is the product of purposefully-arbitrary chaos, just as modernist works of art increasingly turned to the everyday chaotic experience of the city and rapid-fire technologies for their subject matter. Just as life itself began to feel as though it was blurring for many of the modernists in the first half of the twentieth century, so their works reflected an increased pace in which what Virginia Woolf called “moments of being” were more and more often accidental -- and accidents came to seem more and more significant of a higher order hidden behind superficial chaos. Our method of selecting the passages to blow up for the exhibit mimics this experience, treating Ulysses itself as an apparently chaotic welter from which order and significance can be extracted even when -- perhaps especially when -- the particular encounter is itself superficially randomized. 

Although the blown-up text algorithmically selected from the novel provides the fundamental framework for the exhibit, it is only a springboard, an anchor, for each panel; this exhibit places a premium upon moving beyond the textual alone in its displays. As the attached layout indicates, each panel will feature contextual and paratextual materials that call out from the posterized excerpts: 

1. using a quotation from later in the book and/or a later work that evokes it, we will provide historical context for the passage, the novel, and modernism more broadly. Format: text and/or reproduced photographs or images alongside other pertinent media. 
2. we will link the passage to a character in the novel, his or her historical basis, and the broader network of modernist cultural production in which they participated (and which participated in the production of Ulysses by proxy)
3. a visual art work that corresponds or evokes/is evoked by the passage will be hung proximate to the blown-up excerpt from the novel; these works will be selected primarily from the UVAC for their aesthetic correspondence and/or their implication in the network of cultural production that circulated around Joyce and his Ulysses. The Gisèle Freund photographs of Paris in the 1920s and 1930s will be of particular interest here, as will the UVAC's Klimt silkscreen and other materials in that vein (all depending upon availability and permission).  
4. an object or artifact that has been reproduced in 3D; these objects will be selected based upon their appearance in the novel, their contextual importance, and their interest factor as historical objects. We will model the objects from existing digital models/scans or scan objects from museum collections to which we have been given access (including UVAC) for this purpose. The objects will be printed on a MakerBot 3D printer (housed in the Maker Lab at UVic) in a resinous material, meaning that they can be freely handled by visitors to the exhibit without fear of damage or loss (should either occur, we will simply print replacements).  
5. sounds/music that correspond to the contexts will be available for playback. These will include historical recordings of soundscapes from the early twentieth century as well as songs, music, voices, readings, and machines. 
6. other texts that are evoked by/evoke the blown-up passage will themselves be presented in smaller blow-up excerpts and, where possible, in the original or rare editions held by Special Collections (in the locked display cases). At a minimum these will include rare editions of Ulysses, but also works by Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, John Betjeman, Herbert Read, Amelia Laracuen, letters, diaries, advertisements, newspaper pages (we have the 1904 Freeman, e.g.), etc.  

## Center Cabinets

The six cabinets located in the center of the space are organized according to the principle of unanticipated afterlives. They will feature works in which artists and critics have taken up *Ulysses* and its contexts in ways Joyce could not have anticipated: digital manifestations, cinematic renderings, live performances, architectural designs, artistic appropriations, inventive maps, music, etc. In this way the center cabinets will viscerally showcase the "long now" of Joyce's novel, and also raise questions about the transformation of media and representation over time and space.

## Online Presence

Since the novel *Ulysses* is keenly interested in form, rendering our source-text online is both necessary and prudent, since doing so will challenge the audience (and us) to rethink the underlying structure of the words as a *unified* (or disordered) "whole," while giving the text a more permanent space to call *home*. Further, our exhibit will echo *Ulysses*' unique handling of time. By using an algorithm to systematically select portions from the story, the temporality of Joyce's original narrative will be deconstructed; the backbone of the new text will no longer be centred around our expectations regarding "time" in a novel, but instead subordinate to the behest of the algorithm. Our text, therefore, will serve as a performance of agency given to a machine by a human, which is in turn a performance of the questions of man / machine agency that arise more generally in the area of digital humanities. However, rather than a simple argument for the worth of DH, our encoded text will reveal how human intervention permeates even the most ubiquitously digital domains.  

In a way, the sections selected by the algorithm take on a new base form; they become a new *text* that can be studied as an essentially unique framework that is fundamentally representative of the "Long Now of *Ulysses*" exhibit. Providing the digital sampling of the poem with an online presence is useful for a number of pragmatic reasons. For one, the web presence will exist long past the exhibit, and thus act as a reminder that the exhibit was ever there, how it was constructed at its most fundamental level (that is, the new algorithmically constructed “text"), and how one might be able to recreate the exhibit as a whole. Furthermore, by creating an online, marked-up text, the framework of the exhibit will be academically useful to various scholars from various fields using the XML tags, while at the same time remain accessible to the general public using the CSS rendering of the page, wherein the XML tags will remain invisible and unobtrusive, except in the source-code.  

__The digitization of our text will be accomplished as follows:__

1. Each algorithmically selected portion of the text will be encoded in XML, and then rendered as a Browser-readable document using simple, functional CSS, and/or HTML and Javascript as deemed appropriate, following the example of--for instance--the [XML edition of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle] (http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/ "XML ASC")
2. The back-end XML will be extensively marked up according to DTI standards for prose, so that the backbone of the "Long Now of *Ulysses*" (that is, the new foundational "text" as selected by the algorithm) can be easily interrogated on a more abstract/quantitative level in the future.  
3. We will host the encoded text, and all related files, on a stable, publicly accessible web-space.   

This web presence may, but need not, reflect the aesthetic of the library exhibit, since its purpose is to codify, present and preserve the textual framework that lies behind the project's visual manifestation in the library, not to codify, present and preserve the visual manifestation itself.
