# David Carlton Prospectus Edits

*All My Changes to the Prospectus will be Noted (and Usually Explicitly Justified) Here.*

1. Added a new section called "Online Presence"
2. Italicized all instances of *Ulysses*
3. General stylistic edits throughout

__CHANGES TO RATIONALE:__

1. added "form" to the list of modernist preoccupations
2. made the "sine qua non" statement a bit more tentative, and removed talk of "The Waste Land," since mentioning it made it seem like there are only 2 choices for the best example of modernism. False dichotomies are never cool
3. misc. stylistic alterations  

__CHANGES TO CURATION:__

1. In order to dissolve the apparent dichotomy between the content providers and "tech support" (us), I added the line "Both groups will ultimately collaborate on the final presentation and selection of all pertinent materials and technologies, so that the final exhibit is both aesthetically/theoretically functional and technologically feasible."   

__CHANGES TO ORGANIZATION:__

1. No real changes here. Perhaps problems will arise later on?

__CHANGES TO PERIMETER PANELS:__

1. Changed "random" to "purposefully arbitrary chaos" and "chaotic" to better reflect the not-so-random nature of using an algorithm to choose text; changed the general tone of the passage to better accentuate the superficial nature of our text's "randomness."  
2. Noted that the blown up text is the "fundamental framework" of the exhibit; how can we have the "Long now of Ulysses without some basis in the text Ulysses, or at least a recognition of its existence? Because of this, it is "*fundamentally*" important, but not necessarily "*absolute*."  
3. Noted that other visual media can be used, as well - leave it broad  
4. Other minor stylistic alterations  

__CHANGES TO CENTER CABINETS:__

1. More explicitly explained how the displays here will showcase the "long now" of Ulysses, and raise questions about the transformation of media and representation over time and space
